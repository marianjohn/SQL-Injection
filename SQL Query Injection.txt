SQL Query Injection
%27 - indication of query injection, it indictates apostrophe and it breaks out a SQL query and helps in injecting code.
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'John';
if the user inputs
John' OR 1=1--
the query becomes
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'John' OR 1=1--';
-- -> makes the rest of the query as comments.
As a result from ths injection the user will get all rows from the users table.
